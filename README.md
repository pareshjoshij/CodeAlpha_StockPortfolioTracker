# Stock Portfolio Tracker - CodeAlpha Internship Project

This is a simple command-line tool to track the total value of a stock portfolio. It was developed as a project for the CodeAlpha Python Programming internship. The user can input their owned stocks and quantities, and the program calculates the total investment value based on a hardcoded set of prices.

## üéØ Project Goal

The goal is to build a simple stock tracker that calculates the total investment value based on manually defined stock prices and user input. The final portfolio can be optionally saved to a `.txt` file.

## ‚ú® Features

- Allows user to input stock tickers and their quantities.
- Uses a hardcoded dictionary for stock prices (e.g., {"AAPL": 180}).
- Calculates and displays the total portfolio investment value.
- Saves the final portfolio details to a `portfolio.txt` file.

## üöÄ How to Run

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/pareshjoshij/CodeAlpha_StockPortfolioTracker.git
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd CodeAlpha_StockPortfolioTracker
    ```
3.  Run the Python script:
    ```bash
    python stock_tracker.py
    ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Concepts Used

This project utilizes several core Python concepts as required by the task:
- `dictionary` to store stock prices
- User `input/output` handling
- Basic arithmetic operations for value calculation
- `file handling` to save the results
